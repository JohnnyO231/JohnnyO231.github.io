<p><b><u>BALK:</b></u></p>
<p>A balk is an illegal act by the pitcher when one or more runners are on base. A balk will be called when a pitcher who is on the rubber makes any motion naturally associated with his pitching delivery and does not actually deliver the ball, feigns a throw to first or third base and fails to complete the throw, or fails to step directly toward a base before throwing to that base. Once a pitcher has swung his free leg back past the pitching rubber while in the process of his leg kick, he must then deliver the ball to the plate or to second base on a pick-off attempt.</p>


<p><b><u>BLOWN SAVE:</b></u></p>
<p>A blown save occurs when a relief pitcher enters a game in a save situation, but allows the tying run to score. The run does not have to be charged to that pitcher. If a reliever enters with a man already on third base, and he allows that runner to score the tying run, he is charged with a blown save</p>


<p><b><u>CUT OFF MAN:</b></u></p>
<p>This baseball term refers to a fielder who is positioned to receive a ball thrown back towards the infield following a hit or fly ball into the outfield. The designated cut-off man is determined by both how far and to which part of the outfield the ball was hit. If the ball is hit in front of an outfielder, the cut-off man will typically position himself at the outside edge of the infield. If the ball is hit over the outfielder, the cut-off man generally moves into the shallow outfield to receive the cut-off.</p>


<p><b><u>EARNED RUN AVERAGE:</b></u></p>
<p>Earned run average represents the number of earned runs a pitcher allows per nine innings -- with earned runs being any runs that scored without the aid of an error or a passed ball. ERA is the most commonly accepted statistical tool for evaluating pitchers.</p>


<p><b><u>INFIELD FLY:</b></u></p>
<p>The infield fly rule is a rule of baseball that treats certain fly balls as though caught, before the ball is caught and even if the infielder fails to catch it or drops it on purpose. The umpire's declaration of an infield fly means that the batter is out (and all force plays are removed) regardless of whether the ball is caught. The rule exists to prevent the defense from achieving a double play or triple play by failing to catch a ball that an infielder could catch with ordinary effort. The rule is limited to apply only in situations where this result is possible.</p>


<p><b><u>FULL COUNT:</b></u></p>
<p>In baseball a full count is when the batter has 3 balls and 2 strikes. If another ball is thrown without the batter swinging, its a walk (batter automatically gets to 1st base). If another strike is thrown and the batter swings and misses or doesn't swing and the ball is in the strike zone, thats strike 3 and the batter is out. If a foul is hit and not caught the batter continues. The batter could hit as many foul balls and not be out if the ball is not caught. A foul counts as a strike except on the third strike</p>


<p><b><u>FOUL BALL:</b></u></p>
<p>A Foul Ball is a batted ball that settles on foul territory between home and first base, or between home and third base, or that bounds past first or third base on or over foul territory, or that first falls on foul territory beyond first or third base, or that, while on or over foul territory, touches the person of an umpire or player, or any object foreign to the natural ground. A foul fly shall be judged according to the relative position of the ball and the foul line, including the foul pole, and not as to whether the infielder is on foul or fair territory at the time he touches the ball.</p>


<p><b><u>PASSED BALL:</b></u></p>
<p>A catcher is charged with a passed ball when he fails to hold or control a legally pitched ball that, with ordinary effort, should have been maintained under his control, and, as a result of this loss of control, the batter or a runner on base advances. A runner who advances due to a passed ball is not credited with a stolen base unless he breaks for the base before the pitcher begins his delivery. A passed ball may be scored when a base runner reaches the next base on a bobble or missed catch by the catcher, or when the batter-runner reaches first base on an uncaught strike three (see also Strikeout).</p>


<p><b><u>PICKOFF:</b></u></p>
<p>A pickoff occurs between pitches when a pitcher throws a ball to a fielder, who eventually puts out or assists in retiring an opposing baserunner. An illegal pickoff attempt results in a balk.</p>


<p><b><u>RELIEF PITCHER:</b></u></p>
<P>A relief pitcher is a pitcher who comes in for relief of the starting pitcher and replaces him when he becomes tired</p>


<p><b><u>STARTING PITCHER:</b></u></p>
<p>A starting pitcher is a pitcher that starts the baseball game and is the first pitcher to pitch on the field for the game.</p>


<p><b><u>STRIKE ZONE:</b></u></p>
<p>The strike zone is the volume of space through which a pitch must pass in order to count as a strike, if the batter does not swing. The strike zone is defined as the volume of space above home plate and between the batter's knees and the midpoint of their torso. Whether a pitch passed through the zone or not is decided by an umpire, who is generally positioned behind the catcher. Strikes are desirable for the pitcher and the fielding team, as three strikes result in a strikeout of that batter. A pitch that misses the strike zone is called a ball (only if batter doesn't swing). Balls are desirable for the batter and the batting team, as four balls allow the batter to take a "walk" to first base as a base on balls.</p>


<p><b><u>WILD PITCH:</b></u></p>
<p>A wild pitch usually passes the catcher behind home plate, often allowing runners on base an easy chance to advance while the catcher chases the ball down. Sometimes the catcher may block a pitch, and the ball may be nearby, but the catcher has trouble finding the ball, allowing runners to advance. A wild pitch may only be scored if one or more runners advance. If the bases are empty, or the catcher retrieves the ball quickly and the runner(s) are unable to advance, a wild pitch is not charged. A scored run due to a wild pitch is recorded as an earned run. A runner who advances on a wild pitch is not credited with a stolen base unless he breaks before the pitcher begins his delivery.</p>


<p><b><u>WALK:</b></u></p>
<p>A base on balls (BB), also known as a walk, occurs in baseball when a batter receives four pitches that the umpire calls balls, and is in turn awarded first base without the possibility of being called out. The base on balls is defined in Section 2.00 of baseball's Official Rules,[1] and further detail is given in 6.08. It is, however, considered a faux pas for a professional player to actually walk to first base; the batter-runner and any advancing runners normally jog on such a play.</p>
